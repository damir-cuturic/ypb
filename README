NAME
    ypb - YouTube Playlist Backup script

SYNOPSIS
    ypb.py
    ypb.py [-c channelID]

DESCRIPTION
    ypb is a script which retrieves the playlists of a YouTube channel. It
    uses YouTube Data API v3 for accessing the channel's information, and is
    implemented using the Google APIs Client Library for Python. Complete
    backups of public and/or private playlists are possible.

    Note: This is not a Youtube video downloader. This script simply stores
    YouTube playlist information in plaintext, which is helpful when videos
    are unxexpectedly deleted.

USAGE
    There are two ways to use the script. Without arguments, ypb will
    retrieve all of the user's playlists, including private ones. This method
    requires that the user
    allow access to their YouTube account. The script uses the OAuth 2.0
    protocol for this purpose. It will direct the user to an authentication
    page using a web browser, at which point they may allow access through
    Google's authorization server.

    With the -c option, the supplied channel ID is used to retrieve only
    public playlists. No authorization process is required for this method.

    Backups are placed in directories with the following timestamp format:
    %Y%m%d-%H%M%S.

OPTIONS
    -c, --channelid
        Retrieve public playlists for the supplied YouTube channel. No
        authentication is required. The channel ID is embedded in the URL when
        accessing channel-related content, e.g. youtube.com/channel/CHANNELID.
        It may also be viewed via My Channel or by accessing YouTube settings
        -> Advanced -> Account Information.

CREDENTIALS
    To communicate with YouTube Data API the script requires proper
    authorization credentials. Since the keys and files required for
    authorization are not provided, it is up to the user to obtain them. For
    authenticated requests, the client-secrets.json file is required. For
    non-authenticated requests, an API key is required. Please see
    https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application for more
    information regarding authorization credentials.
